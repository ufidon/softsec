## Lab01: Setup the lab environment

__Description__

Setup the lab environment and get familiar with the SEED VM. You need a USB 3.0+ thumb drive or USB 3.0+ SSD with at least 256GB or install on your own laptop with free space of at least 256GB.

* *Rule of thumb to choose software: always choose the latest and STABLE version*
* Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and the extension pack
* Download the [SEED VM](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/) form its official website
* Choose an installation approach and follow the corresponding [SEED manuals](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/labsetup.html) to install a SEED environment.
* Here we choose [Installing SEED VM](https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-labs/blob/master/manuals/vm/seedvm-manual.md) on a local computer.
* Browse and play with the integrated software
* Practice the basic Linux commands on the [Linux command memento](https://bootlin.com/doc/legacy/command-line/)
* *If SEED VMs can NOT adjust to full screen automatically, it can be changed manually inside the VM. System Settings -> Display -> Resolution (change it what you want.)*
