This lab is revised from [SEED Buffer-Overflow Vulnerability Lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_16.04/Software/Buffer_Overflow/)

**1. Tasks to be complete:**

Complete the following tasks described in [SEED Buffer-Overflow Vulnerability Lab](../lab06/refs/BufferOverflow.pdf):

*The BUF_SIZE in stack.c must be 240*

- [ ] Task 1: Running Shellcode
- [ ] Task 2: Exploiting the Vulnerability
- [x] Task 3(30%): Defeating dash’s Countermeasure
- [x] Task 4(30%): Defeating Address Randomization
- [x] Task 5(20%): Turn on the StackGuard Protection
- [x] Task 6(20%): Turn on the Non-executable Stack Protection


**2. Report**

Write a report about the process you complete the tasks in the description, key screen snapshots are needed as evidences. In your report, each task has its own subsection.
